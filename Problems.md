1. **Binary Tree Traversal (Easy):**
   
   Implement a function to perform an inorder traversal of a binary tree.

2. **Binary Tree Maximum Depth (Easy):**
   
   Write a function to find the maximum depth (height) of a binary tree.

3. **Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (Medium):**
   
   Create a function to perform a level order traversal of a binary tree.

4. **Binary Tree Diameter (Medium):**
   
   Find the diameter of a binary tree, which is the length of the longest path between any two nodes.

5. **Binary Tree Is Balanced (Easy):**
   
   Write a function to determine if a binary tree is balanced, meaning the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.

6. **Binary Tree Lowest Common Ancestor (Medium):**
   
   Given two nodes in a binary tree, find their lowest common ancestor.

7. **Binary Tree Path Sum (Easy):**
   
   Determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals a given sum.

8. **Binary Tree Serialize and Deserialize (Hard):**
   
   Implement functions to serialize and deserialize a binary tree.

9. **Binary Tree Mirror (Easy):**
   
   Convert a binary tree to its mirror image by swapping the left and right subtrees.

10. **Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal (Medium):**
    
    Modify your level order traversal code to traverse the tree in a zigzag pattern (left to right for the first level, right to left for the second, and so on).

11. **Binary Tree Inorder Successor (Medium):**
    
    Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

12. **Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal (Medium):**
    
    Implement a function to return the vertical order traversal of a binary tree.

13. **Binary Tree Sum of Left Leaves (Easy):**
    
    Write a function to find the sum of all left leaves in a given binary tree.

14. **Binary Tree Tilt (Easy):**
    
    Calculate the tilt of a binary tree. The tilt of a binary tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values.


15. **Binary Tree All Paths (Medium):**
    
    Given a binary tree, create a function to return all root-to-leaf paths as a list of lists.

16. **Binary Tree Trim (Easy):**
    
    Given a binary search tree and two values, trim the tree so that all elements are between those two values.

17. **Binary Tree Count Univalue Subtrees (Medium):**
    
    Implement a function to count the number of univalue subtrees in a binary tree. A univalue subtree has all nodes with the same value.


18. **Binary Tree Maximum Sum Path (Hard):**
    
    Find the maximum path sum between any two nodes in a binary tree. The path may start and end at any node in the tree.


19. **Binary Tree Lowest Common Ancestor (BST Version - Easy):**
    
    Given a binary search tree and two nodes, write a function to find their lowest common ancestor.

20. **Binary Tree Convert to Doubly Linked List (Medium):**
    
    Convert a binary search tree to a sorted circular doubly linked list in-place.
